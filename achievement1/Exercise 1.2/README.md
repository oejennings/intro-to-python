# Exercise 1.2

## Exercise Goals: 
- Use data types and methods to execute Python commands that store recipes containing their
own internal data
- Enter a number of these recipes into another linear data structure

## Exercise Files: 
- learning journal entry 1.2
- screenshots of creating dictionaires recipes 1-5, creating list of all recipes, and printing a list of each recipes ingredients. 

### Data Stucture Reasoning
- For outer structure all_recipes I chose a list, becuase lists are mutable so they can be modified if needed.
- For storing the data of each recipe I chose to use dictionaries, because of its flexibility in storing different data types.
