Exercise 1.1: Getting Started with Python

1. In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?
	Frontend web development is creating the what the user will see and interact with on an application. Backend web development is working on the server side of the application, like interacting with databases and APIs, compiling web pages, and processing user requests.

2. Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option?
	Python and JavaScript are both high level scripting languages that executes commands using standard syntax. They are both easily understandable and uses dynamic typing. Python, though similar to JS, is more versatile in its open-source and proprietary packages that can be used. Using its multitude of packages it helps simplify elaborate operations into a more condensed function. It also comes pre-installed with some common web operations which helps developers get started easier and faster. Lastly, its community is one of the largest and most cooperative which makes it a great choice for most applications. 

3. Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you. What do you want to learn about Python? What do you want to get out of this Achievement? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?
	1. I want to learn more complex functions using Python.
	2. I want to see how building an application using Python is different from JavaScript. 
	3. I want to broaden my coding skills to help open myself up for more job opportunities.
